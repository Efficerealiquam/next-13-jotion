This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Second, run the development server for Convex:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

## Required Credentials:
- In order to start Convex (https://www.convex.dev/) you would need the necessary credentials for its execution.
- The credentials for https://dashboard.clerk.com/ that are used to manage login and user creation would be needed.
- You need your account at https://dashboard.edgestore.dev and obtain the credentials to manage the image repository.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
